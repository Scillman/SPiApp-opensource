# Instructions
The directories in this directory are divided into two groups: maps and mods. Both contain the templates for their respective type. The directories in them, e.g. __mods/default__, are visible in the tools. Their files are copied to the Call of Duty 4 directory when the respective template has been selected during creation.

## Maps
The templates for maps are located in __maps/*__ and their keyword is __yourmapname__. The keyword will be replaced with the actual name of the map during creation. This can be used for directory names, file names and as content in text files.

## Mods
The templates for mods are located in __mods/**__ and their keyword is __yourmodname__. As per the rest it follows the same rules as for the maps.
